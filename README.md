# IMDB Score Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate IMDb scores for movies based on various features, including genre, director, cast, budget, and more. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model helps determine factors influencing a movie's success and overall rating. This prediction model could be valuable for filmmakers, studios, and streaming platforms to gauge audience reception.

### Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset undergoes cleaning, handling of missing values, and encoding of categorical data to prepare it for model training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Features such as budget, genre, and cast are carefully analyzed and transformed to optimize model performance.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Various regression algorithms, including Linear Regression and Random Forest, are trained and evaluated on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to find the most accurate model.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language used.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical calculations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for training and evaluating models.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Conclusion
The IMDB Score Prediction model successfully demonstrates the feasibility of predicting movie ratings based on pre-release attributes. By accurately estimating IMDb scores, the model can aid stakeholders in making data-driven decisions regarding production investments and marketing strategies. Future work could explore additional features, such as audience reviews and release timing, to further enhance predictive accuracy.
